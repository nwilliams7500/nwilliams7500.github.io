### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    I really enjoyed Lab 5, part 2 as it was quite simple to complete and all came together, instructions and all, quite nicely. The creation of the functions themselves was easily completed. My partner was also incredibly nice in helping me understand what was happening within the functions.
* Lab 8
    My personal favorite was lab 8, but the entire thing as my partner was amazing to work with. Christian was such a blast to get the lab assignment done with that it was finished rather quickly too! The second part of the lab was the most fun with the double nested loops, which we had managed to get working first try.
* Lab 11
    For my final favorite lab, number 11 was quite enjoyable. My partner Sydnee and I managed to complete it in class after having been stuck on part 1 for some time. It clicked and the function calling all started to make since and we flew through the rest of the lab!
